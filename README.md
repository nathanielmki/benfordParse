# benfordParse
Repo for Benford Parse web application, built with Flask and Docker

## Preamble

In 1938, Frank Benford published a paper showing the distribution of the leading digit in many disparate sources of data. In all these sets of data, the number 1 was the leading digit about 30% of the time. Benfordâ€™s law has been found to apply to population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, mathematical distributions given by some power law, and physical constants like atomic weights and specific heats.

`benfordParse` allows users to submit a data file, select a column to analyze, and test their dataset against Benfords Law. The expected output of this program is table containing the distribution of found counts against expected, as well as a plot graphing the distribution. This output is saved within `/static/results` directory.

## Instructions
The following instructions assume you have `python3`, `pip`, and `venv` already installed on your system.


First, clone the repository from Github and `cd` into it. Then activate the included python virtual environment with `source benfordParse_env/bin/activate`.

Once activated, install all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Launch the flask application by executing `python3 -m flask run` in the app root directory.

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` in your web-browser, or `ctrl/cmd-click` the link in the terminal to begin using the webapp.
