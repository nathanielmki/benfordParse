# benfordParse
Repo for Benford Parse web application, built with Flask

## Preamble

In 1938, Frank Benford published a paper showing the distribution of the leading digit in many disparate sources of data. In all these sets of data, the number 1 was the leading digit about 30% of the time. Benfordâ€™s law has been found to apply to population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, mathematical distributions given by some power law, and physical constants like atomic weights and specific heats.

`benfordParse` allows users to submit a data file, select a column to analyze, and test their dataset against Benfords Law. The expected output of this program is table containing the distribution of found counts against expected, as well as a plot graphing the distribution. This output is saved within `/static/results` directory.

## Installation Instructions
The following instructions assume you have `python3`, `pip`, and `venv` already installed on your system.

First, clone the repository from Github and `cd` into it. Then activate the included python virtual environment with `source benfordParse_env/bin/activate`.

Once activated, install all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Launch the flask application by executing `python3 -m flask run` in the app root directory.

Navigate to `127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser, or `ctrl/cmd-click` the link in the terminal to begin using the webapp.

## How to Use

From the start page, users are greeted by three input fields:
* `Choose File`: Allows users to browse their filesystem and select a file for testing.
* The second field allows users to specify which column the want to operate on.
* Finally, the third field lets users name their output files

Upon hitting submit, users are redirected to the results page, which displays the `Expected vs. Found Distribution` of digits 1-9 in your dataset.

To view the raw CSV file that was used to generate the graph, select `Choose File` under "View Raw Data", browse to the named CSV file in the `/static/results` directory and click `Submit`.

## Locating Files

You can also view the images and file generated by the app by browsing to `/static/results` in a file browser. Any file uploaded is also saved for future reference, in the `/upload` directory.
