# benfordParse
Repo for Benford Parse web application, built with Flask and Docker

## Preamble

In 1938, Frank Benford published a paper showing the distribution of the leading digit in many disparate sources of data. In all these sets of data, the number 1 was the leading digit about 30% of the time. Benfordâ€™s law has been found to apply to population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, mathematical distributions given by some power law, and physical constants like atomic weights and specific heats.

`benfordParse` allows users to submit a data file, select a column to analyze, and test their dataset against Benfords Law. The expected output of this program is table containing the distribution of found counts against expected, as well as a plot graphing the distribution. This output is saved within a nested username directory, with the contents of their run contained within a user-specified project-id directory.

## Instructions

This application can be ran in one of two ways, either executed through `flask run` or through running as a Docker container. Details on launching as both below:
